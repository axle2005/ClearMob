To Do
-Item clear - If amount of minecraft:item is over x number, it will clear every 5th? one. 

-Filter Zombie Villagers

-You're injecting the logger, but not actually using it. Don't send stuff to the console, just log it.

-Your code has some interesting quirks. For instance, why are you creating a new Object[] in your getNode calls, when it's a vararg? Why are you using a numerical iterator over list_entities?

-Just type args.checkPermission(src, "clearmob.run") and it'll do the permission checking for you.

-Your commands can be improved - this2 describes a better way of making your CommandSpec. You then make different classes for different executors, eliminating parsing entirely.

-You're injecting the configuration loader, and then not using it. This throws away Sponge's custom configuration settings, such as being able to retrieve objects like Text directly from the config, as well as hardcoding where files go. Other things that you can load directly from the config include EntityTypes, which mean that you can use them directly instead of your strings.
 
-CommandResults should be useful; why not do CommandResult.builder().queryResult(removedEntities).build()?


Completed

-Do different things at different times. For example: Config stuff is available at GamePreInitializationEvent.
-In accordance with the above point, you should be injecting the default config for the path as well as the configuration loader, instead of the config dir - this lets Sponge decide where the configuration file goes.
-For the above point, it's important that you remember: In singleplayer, the server can stop and start multiple times, or not ever start, meaning that your commands and config and stuff might never get registered, or may get done multiple times. This is not a good idea. All things relating to loading should be done in events related to initialization, e.g. config in pre init, commands in init, etc.
-You don't need to initialize list_entities with an ArrayList if you're just going to load it from the config at the earliest opportunity.
-Don't return null in commands, ever. You should be throwing CommandException if the command failed.
-You have a lot of exception catchers that do nothing. At the very least you should print a stack trace.
-Absolutely none of the statics in Config need to be static.
-Just a minor gripe, but Java conventions for variables are camelCase instead of under_score.
-Instead of making your own reload command, listen for GameReloadEvent and do your logic there.
